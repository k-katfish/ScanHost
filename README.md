# ScanHost

Simply launch ScanHost.exe, and view scanned information about "this" computer (localhost). If you'd like, you can scan a remote computer by entering the name of the computer into the box then click "Scan", wait a moment, then view the results of the scan. Note - In order to scan a remote computer you'll need to be a member of the Remote Access group or the Administrators Group.
